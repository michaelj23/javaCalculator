	There were several issues I encountered while making this Java Calculator. One  initial problem I came across was accounting for negative numbers when parsing the user's input. Another issue that came up during parsing was multi-character numbers; I had to make sure that a number like 23 was not interpreted as 2 separate numbers 2 and 3. Probably the most striking issue that arose in the project was the special case of let. The other operators all took in two arguments that were evaluated before being applied to the operator. Let, however, takes in three arguments and first assigns a binding between the first 2 arguments before evaluating the third. I had to account for this in my evaluation method. 
	I spent the most time on parsing user input into a format that could easily be evaluated. I ended up converting expressions into Linked Lists that ccould have nested Linked Lists inside. This was convenient because it allowed me to easily translate subexpressions into nested lists.
	If I had more time, I would definitely improve upon the Calculator's tests to test for edge cases and exceptions, something that I was not able to figure out. I would also learn how to incorporate a logging layer into my app to ease debugging and handle potential crashes. I would also like to become more comfortable with using Maven to build my apps.
